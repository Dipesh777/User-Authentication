# User Authentication App

User authentication is a process that allows a device to verify the identify of someone who connects to a network resource.
There are many technologies currently available to a network administrator to authenticate users.

This Application verifies the identity of a user attempting to gain access to a network or computing resource by authorizing a human-to-machine transfer of credentials during interactions on a network to confirm a user's authenticity.
In this Application User can Add Notes and Keep them to view them later or when ever user needed.
